MODIFICATIONS: this file has been modified in this package to
build against leanprover/lean4:v4.34.0 and its matching Mathlib. The changes made here,
relative to the upstream v4.33.0 file, are:
  * this notice was prepended;
  * every `import` line naming a sibling module of this chain was re-rooted from
    `Causalean.Mathlib.Probability.SteinMethod.…` to `Multiway.SteinCLT.…`, the upstream
    file names `Bounds_Part1.lean` / `Bounds_Part2.lean` becoming `BoundsPart1.lean` /
    `BoundsPart2.lean` so that the module names carry no underscore;
  * ONE proof-level repair: `Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Order.Group.Lattice` was added to the
    import list, because `Measurable.abs` (the `to_additive` image of `Measurable.mabs`) is
    no longer reachable through the upstream import set at this Mathlib pin. Without it the
    dot-notation `(hmeas i).abs` unfolds `Measurable` and reports `Invalid field 'abs': the
    environment does not contain 'Function.abs'`. No proof text changed.
No mathematical content, no declaration name, no namespace (the upstream namespace
`Causalean.Mathlib.Probability.SteinMethod` is kept exactly as written), no docstring and no
attribution of the upstream file was removed or altered.

Lean's new module system (`module`, `public import`, `@[expose] public section`) is kept
exactly as upstream wrote it: v4.34.0 accepts these files unchanged in that respect, so no
`module` or `public` marker was stripped.

Every repair is marked in place with a `-- PORT v4.34.0:` comment saying what changed.

# The local-dependence Stein bound (Chen–Goldstein–Shao / Ross)

For a finite family `X : ι → Ω → ℝ` of mean-zero random variables with `Var(∑ Xᵢ) = 1` and
*dependency neighborhoods* `N i` (each `Xᵢ` independent of `∑_{j∉Nᵢ} Xⱼ`), the standardized sum
`W = ∑ Xᵢ` satisfies, for a `C²`-ish test function `h` with `‖h'‖ ≤ L`,

    |E[h(W)] − E[h(Z)]| ≤ 2L·√(Var(∑ᵢ Xᵢ·Tᵢ)) + L·∑ᵢ E[|Xᵢ|·Tᵢ²],   Tᵢ = ∑_{j∈Nᵢ} Xⱼ,

via the Stein equation `E[h(W)] − E[h(Z)] = E[f'(W) − W·f(W)]` (`f = steinSol h`), the
independence (which kills `E[Xᵢ·f(W−Tᵢ)] = 0`), a covariance/Cauchy–Schwarz bound for the
first term (using `‖f'‖ ≤ 2L` and `E[∑ᵢXᵢTᵢ] = Var W = 1`), and a second-order Taylor bound for
the second term (using that `f'` is `2L`-Lipschitz).

# Local-dependence Stein bound

This file defines the standardized sum `depSum`, the neighborhood sum
`nbhdSum`, and proves the Chen-Goldstein-Shao/Ross style
`stein_local_dependence_bound` for a finite family of mean-zero random
variables with dependency neighborhoods. The bound controls the difference
between expectations under the standardized sum and the standard normal by two
local-dependence error terms.

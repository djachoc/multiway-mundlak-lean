MODIFICATIONS: this file has been modified in this package to
build against leanprover/lean4:v4.34.0 and its matching Mathlib. The changes made here,
relative to the upstream v4.33.0 file, are:
  * this notice was prepended;
  * every `import` line naming a sibling module of this chain was re-rooted from
    `Causalean.Mathlib.Probability.SteinMethod.…` to `Multiway.SteinCLT.…`, the upstream
    file names `Bounds_Part1.lean` / `Bounds_Part2.lean` becoming `BoundsPart1.lean` /
    `BoundsPart2.lean` so that the module names carry no underscore;
No mathematical content, no declaration name, no namespace (the upstream namespace
`Causalean.Mathlib.Probability.SteinMethod` is kept exactly as written), no docstring and no
attribution of the upstream file was removed or altered.

Lean's new module system (`module`, `public import`, `@[expose] public section`) is kept
exactly as upstream wrote it: v4.34.0 accepts these files unchanged in that respect, so no
`module` or `public` marker was stripped.

Every repair is marked in place with a `-- PORT v4.34.0:` comment saying what changed.

# Uniform bounds on the Stein solution (Chen–Goldstein–Shao)

For an absolutely continuous test function `h` with bounded derivative `‖h'‖_∞ ≤ L`, the Stein
solution `f_h` is uniformly bounded by `L` and its derivative by `2·L`:

    ‖f_h‖_∞ ≤ L,   ‖f_h'‖_∞ ≤ 2·L.

This file proves `steinSol_deriv_abs_le` and `steinSol_deriv_lipschitz`; the
companion bound `steinSol_abs_le` is proved in `Bounds_Part1`. The last packages the
second-derivative bound
as Lipschitz control of `f_h'`. The proof develops the needed Gaussian tail
moment identities, two-sided lower Mills-ratio bounds, and the cancellation
inequalities behind Chen-Goldstein-Shao Lemma 2.4, equation (2.13). These are
the bounds that make the local-dependence Stein estimate work for test functions such as
`h = cos(t * ·)` and `h = sin(t * ·)`.

/-! ### Lower Mills-ratio bound

The derivative bound needs a *lower* bound on the Gaussian tail
`∫_{Ioi w} φ ≥ (w/(w²+1))·φ w` for `w ≥ 0` (in fact for all `w`).  We obtain it from the
fact that `hMills w := ∫_{Ioi w} φ − (w/(w²+1))·φ w` is antitone with limit `0` at `+∞`. -/

/-! ### Second-derivative bound `‖f_h''‖ ≤ 2L`

The Stein equation `f' = w·f + (h − c)` differentiates to `f'' = f + w·f' + h'`, where the term
`w·f'` is individually unbounded.  Substituting the Stein equation once more gives the *crux*
`f'' = (1+w²)·f + w·(h − c) + h'`, and the unbounded part is precisely `(1+w²)·f + w·(h − c)`,
which is in fact bounded by `L` thanks to the two-sided lower Mills bounds — this is the
cancellation underlying Chen–Goldstein–Shao Lemma 2.4, equation (2.13). The pure inequality below
packages it. -/

/-- The analytic crux of the *second*-derivative bound, as a pure real inequality.  With
`e = e^{w²/2}`, `p = ∫_{Ioi w}φ`, `q = ∫_{Iic w}φ`, `f = φ w`, `k = √(2π)`, and the two
coefficients `cA = (1+w²)·e·p − w`, `cB = (1+w²)·e·q + w` (both nonnegative by the lower Mills
bounds), one has the sharp identity `(w q + f)·cA + (f − w p)·cB = k`.  Together with
`|a| ≤ L·(w q + f)` and `|b| ≤ L·(f − w p)` this yields `|a·cA − b·cB| ≤ k·L`. -/

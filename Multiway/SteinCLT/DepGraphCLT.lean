MODIFICATIONS: this file has been modified in this package to
build against leanprover/lean4:v4.34.0 and its matching Mathlib. The changes made here,
relative to the upstream v4.33.0 file, are:
  * this notice was prepended;
  * every `import` line naming a sibling module of this chain was re-rooted from
    `Causalean.Mathlib.Probability.SteinMethod.…` to `Multiway.SteinCLT.…`, the upstream
    file names `Bounds_Part1.lean` / `Bounds_Part2.lean` becoming `BoundsPart1.lean` /
    `BoundsPart2.lean` so that the module names carry no underscore;
  * ONE proof-level repair, at the two `AEMeasurable` tuple steps inside
    `DepGraph.indep_nbhdProd`: `measurable_pi_lambda` is now only a deprecated alias of
    `Measurable.of_eval`, which drops the old explicit function argument. The upstream call
    `measurable_pi_lambda _ (fun k => D.meas ↑k)` therefore still RESOLVES but is over-applied,
    and fails downstream with an application type mismatch mentioning `MeasurableSet`, not
    with an unknown identifier. Both call sites now name `Measurable.of_eval` and drop the
    leading `_`. No other proof text changed.
No mathematical content, no declaration name, no namespace (the upstream namespace
`Causalean.Mathlib.Probability.SteinMethod` is kept exactly as written), no docstring and no
attribution of the upstream file was removed or altered.

Lean's new module system (`module`, `public import`, `@[expose] public section`) is kept
exactly as upstream wrote it: v4.34.0 accepts these files unchanged in that respect, so no
`module` or `public` marker was stripped.

Every repair is marked in place with a `-- PORT v4.34.0:` comment saying what changed.

# The dependency-graph CLT from primitive conditions

`stein_cdf_clt` needs the two Stein negligibility limits (`Var(∑XᵢTᵢ)→0`, `∑E[|Xᵢ|Tᵢ²]→0`) and
the leave-out independence as hypotheses. Here we derive them from a standard dependency graph:
a reflexive symmetric relation `G` on the index set whose non-adjacent index sets carry independent
variable tuples, with bounded degree `m`, together with bounded summands `|Xᵢ| ≤ Bₙ` such that
`Bₙ → 0` and `N·Bₙ³ → 0`. This is a graph-based local-dependence condition of the kind
studied by Chen–Shao. Aronow–Samii impose a bounded-degree dependency graph on exposure variables
in their Condition 5; that applied setting is an instance of the abstract graph condition used here.

The covariance `Cov(XᵢTᵢ, XⱼTⱼ)` vanishes unless `i,j` are at graph distance at most three
(so the closed neighborhoods `Nᵢ, Nⱼ` are not separated); there are `≤ N·m³` such pairs, each
bounded by `2(m·Bₙ²)²`, giving `Var(∑XᵢTᵢ) ≤ 2m⁵·N·Bₙ⁴ → 0`; and
`∑E[|Xᵢ|Tᵢ²] ≤ m²·N·Bₙ³ → 0`.  The
leave-out independence is the dependency-graph property applied to `{i}` and `Nᵢᶜ`.  See

# Dependency-graph central limit theorem from primitive graph conditions

This file derives the local-dependence Stein hypotheses from a dependency graph
with bounded degree and uniformly small summands. It defines `DepGraph` and
`DepGraph.nbhd`, proves leave-out independence, separated-neighborhood
covariance cancellation, the bounds `DepGraph.var_nbhd_prod_le` and
`DepGraph.sum_E_nbhd_sq_le`, and concludes with the CDF central limit theorem
`stein_cdf_clt_of_depGraph`.

/-- **The bounded dependency-graph CLT.** Fix, for each `n`, [a probability measure
`μ n`](hyp:μ), [triangular-array summands `X n i`](hyp:X), and [a dependency graph `D n` on the
index set recording which pairs of summands may be dependent](hyp:D), with [every dependency
neighborhood of size at most `m`](hyp:hdeg). Suppose the summands are [uniformly bounded in
absolute value by a constant sequence `B n`](hyp:hB,hbound) that [tends to zero](hyp:hB0), with
[the product of the index-set cardinality and the cube of the bound also tending to
zero](hyp:hNB3), and suppose each summand is [mean zero](hyp:hmean) with [the standardized sum
having unit total variance](hyp:hvar). Then [for every threshold `s`, the CDF of the dependency
sum under `μ n` at `s` converges, as `n → ∞`, to the standard-normal CDF at `s`](goal). The two
Stein negligibility limits are derived internally. -/

MODIFICATIONS: this file has been modified in this package to
build against leanprover/lean4:v4.34.0 and its matching Mathlib. The changes made here,
relative to the upstream v4.33.0 file, are:
  * this notice was prepended;
  * every `import` line naming a sibling module of this chain was re-rooted from
    `Causalean.Mathlib.Probability.SteinMethod.…` to `Multiway.SteinCLT.…`, the upstream
    file names `Bounds_Part1.lean` / `Bounds_Part2.lean` becoming `BoundsPart1.lean` /
    `BoundsPart2.lean` so that the module names carry no underscore;
No mathematical content, no declaration name, no namespace (the upstream namespace
`Causalean.Mathlib.Probability.SteinMethod` is kept exactly as written), no docstring and no
attribution of the upstream file was removed or altered.

Lean's new module system (`module`, `public import`, `@[expose] public section`) is kept
exactly as upstream wrote it: v4.34.0 accepts these files unchanged in that respect, so no
`module` or `public` marker was stripped.

Every repair is marked in place with a `-- PORT v4.34.0:` comment saying what changed.

# Standardized bounded-degree dependency-graph CLT

A standardization wrapper around the abstract Stein dependency-graph CLT
`Causalean.Mathlib.Probability.SteinMethod.stein_cdf_clt_of_depGraph`. The engine
consumes an array that has *already*
been standardized to unit variance with a summand bound tending to `0` and a Lyapunov limit
`card · Bₙ³ → 0`. Real applications instead arrive with fixed bounded summands `|X| ≤ M`, a raw
second moment `∫ (∑ᵢ Xᵢ)² = vₙ`, and a linear variance floor `c · card ιₙ ≤ vₙ` — so this file
supplies the missing layer: it divides through by `√vₙ`, re-derives unit variance, converts the
summand bound into `Bₙ = (M/√c)/√(card ιₙ)`, discharges `card · Bₙ³ → 0` internally, and adds the
prefix-shift plumbing for the eventual-hypothesis variants. Downstream a user can invoke it on raw
mean-zero bounded summands and get CDF convergence of `(∑ᵢ Xᵢ)/√vₙ` to `N(0,1)` in one step.

/-- For every measurable sample space, finite index set, measure, and real-valued random-variable
family, [a dependency graph for that family](hyp:D), and [any real constant $s$](hyp:s), the
[rescaled dependency graph](goal) is a dependency graph for the variables obtained by dividing
each original variable by $s$. It retains the original adjacency relation, including its
reflexivity and symmetry, and its measurability and independence properties.

Dividing every summand in a dependency graph by the same deterministic constant preserves the
graph and transfers the independence field by measurable post-composition. -/

/-- **Bounded-degree dependency-graph CLT (raw, variance-floor form).** Fix, for each `n`,
[a probability measure `μ n`](hyp:μ), [triangular-array summands `X n i`](hyp:X), and [a
dependency graph `Dep n` on the index set](hyp:Dep), with [every dependency neighborhood of size
at most a fixed bound `Dmax`](hyp:hdeg). Suppose the summands are [uniformly bounded in absolute
value by a nonnegative constant `M`](hyp:hM,hbound) and [mean zero](hyp:hmean), with [the total
variance `v n`](hyp:hv) satisfying, for [a strictly positive constant `c`](hyp:hc), [a floor
`v n ≥ c · card (ι n)` eventually in `n`](hyp:hvc); suppose also [the index-set cardinality
diverges to infinity](hyp:hcard). Then [for every threshold `s`, the CDF of the standardized sum
`depSum (X n) / √(v n)` under `μ n` at `s` converges, as `n → ∞`, to the standard-normal CDF at
`s`](goal). The index-size divergence together with the variance floor forces the Lyapunov ratio
`card (ι n) · (M / √(v n))³ → 0` that drives the underlying Stein bound. -/

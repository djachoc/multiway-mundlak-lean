MODIFICATIONS: this file has been modified in this package to
build against leanprover/lean4:v4.34.0 and its matching Mathlib. The changes made here,
relative to the upstream v4.33.0 file, are:
  * this notice was prepended;
  * every `import` line naming a sibling module of this chain was re-rooted from
    `Causalean.Mathlib.Probability.SteinMethod.…` to `Multiway.SteinCLT.…`, the upstream
    file names `Bounds_Part1.lean` / `Bounds_Part2.lean` becoming `BoundsPart1.lean` /
    `BoundsPart2.lean` so that the module names carry no underscore;
No mathematical content, no declaration name, no namespace (the upstream namespace
`Causalean.Mathlib.Probability.SteinMethod` is kept exactly as written), no docstring and no
attribution of the upstream file was removed or altered.

Lean's new module system (`module`, `public import`, `@[expose] public section`) is kept
exactly as upstream wrote it: v4.34.0 accepts these files unchanged in that respect, so no
`module` or `public` marker was stripped.

Every repair is marked in place with a `-- PORT v4.34.0:` comment saying what changed.

# The Stein equation and its solution (standard normal)

Stein's method for normal approximation rests on the *Stein equation*
`f'(w) − w·f(w) = h(w) − E[h(Z)]`, `Z ∼ 𝒩(0,1)`. For a bounded measurable `h` the bounded
solution is

    f_h(w) = e^{w²/2} ∫_{-∞}^{w} (h(x) − E[h(Z)]) e^{−x²/2} dx.

This file defines `steinSol`, proves it solves the Stein equation (`steinSol_hasDerivAt`), and
records the subtractive form `steinSol_stein_eq`. Uniform bounds for the solution and its
derivatives are proved in `Causalean.Mathlib.Probability.SteinMethod.Bounds`.

# Stein equation for the standard normal distribution

This file defines `gExpect`, the bounded solution `steinSol` of the
standard-normal Stein equation, and the two public identities
`steinSol_hasDerivAt` and `steinSol_stein_eq`. The supporting lemmas establish
the Gaussian expectation and integrability facts needed by the Stein-method
bounds.

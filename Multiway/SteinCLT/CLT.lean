MODIFICATIONS: this file has been modified in this package to
build against leanprover/lean4:v4.34.0 and its matching Mathlib. The changes made here,
relative to the upstream v4.33.0 file, are:
  * this notice was prepended;
  * every `import` line naming a sibling module of this chain was re-rooted from
    `Causalean.Mathlib.Probability.SteinMethod.…` to `Multiway.SteinCLT.…`, the upstream
    file names `Bounds_Part1.lean` / `Bounds_Part2.lean` becoming `BoundsPart1.lean` /
    `BoundsPart2.lean` so that the module names carry no underscore;
  * ONE proof-level repair, in `stein_cdf_clt`: `Measure.isProbabilityMeasure_map` no longer
    exists at this Mathlib pin, having been replaced by the iff-form
    `Measure.isProbabilityMeasure_map_iff`. The single call site now takes the right-to-left
    direction of that iff, which is the same statement. No other proof text changed.
No mathematical content, no declaration name, no namespace (the upstream namespace
`Causalean.Mathlib.Probability.SteinMethod` is kept exactly as written), no docstring and no
attribution of the upstream file was removed or altered.

Lean's new module system (`module`, `public import`, `@[expose] public section`) is kept
exactly as upstream wrote it: v4.34.0 accepts these files unchanged in that respect, so no
`module` or `public` marker was stripped.

Every repair is marked in place with a `-- PORT v4.34.0:` comment saying what changed.

# The bounded local-dependence central limit theorem

Assembling the Stein machinery: for a sequence of triangular arrays `Xₙ : ιₙ → Ωₙ → ℝ` that are
mean-zero with `Var(∑ Xₙ) = 1`, equipped with dependency neighborhoods, and whose two Stein
error terms vanish (`Var(∑ XᵢTᵢ) → 0` and `∑ E[|Xᵢ|Tᵢ²] → 0`), the standardized sum
`Wₙ = ∑ Xₙ` converges in distribution to a standard normal — concretely, the CDF converges,
`P[Wₙ ≤ s] → Φ(s)` for every `s`.

Route: the local-dependence Stein bound (`stein_local_dependence_bound`) applied to the test
functions `cos(t·)`, `sin(t·)` (so `L = |t|`) gives characteristic-function convergence
`charFun(law Wₙ)(t) → e^{−t²/2}`; the `clt` package's Lévy continuity theorem upgrades this to
weak convergence of the laws to the standard Gaussian; and the portmanteau theorem (the Gaussian
CDF has no atoms) yields pointwise CDF convergence.

# Local-dependence central limit theorem via Stein bounds

This file converts the local-dependence Stein estimate into CDF convergence to
the standard normal law. It proves the reusable implication
`cdf_tendsto_of_charFun_tendsto` from pointwise characteristic-function
convergence to pointwise Gaussian CDF convergence, then applies the Stein bound
to cosine and sine test functions in the bounded local-dependence central limit
theorem `stein_cdf_clt`.
